Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your instructors and classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.  For a refresher on the course **Collaboration Policy** click [here](https://github.com/dblarremore/csci3022/blob/master/resources/syllabus.md#collaboration-policy).\n",

    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n",
    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Cell $\\rightarrow$ Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",

    "Suppose that you are the grader for an Introduction to Data Science course and your boss has asked you to write an autograder for a homework problem on simulation.  Specifically, students have been asked to write a simulation to estimate the expected number of rolls it will take until doubles are rolled with a pair of fair, six-sided dice (i.e. until both dice show the same value).  The students have been asked to structure their code so that it runs many trials of the experiment and returns the sample mean of the trials, as well as an array containing the result of each individual trial. \n",
